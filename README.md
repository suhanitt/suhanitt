Hi, Iâ€™m @suhanitt
Today we will be disscusing the importance of aminal cruelty in SeaWorld. SeaWorld is an American owned animal theme park chain that has locations in 3 different states. Over 1
million people visit the park every year, and they make millions every year. Eric Balfour told PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) that going to a place like 
SeaWorld is contributing to the animal's tourture. He tells them that they shove 140 dolphins into just 7 tanks often breeding them. Some photographs have been taken of dolphins 
having open wounds and yet the operaters still make them preform. The sea creatures are kept with non compatible tankmates. fighting occurs which lead to woundswhich are 
somethimes fatal. Staff members have to drug some of them to relaive them of their frustration. Teeth get broken from chewing on metal bars and concrete walls of their enclosures. 
In 2013, a doucument named Blackfish came out that in the end, helped end the breeding of orcas. The star of that documentary, Tilikum, died in a SeaWorld tank after 33 years in 
captivity. Shamu is an orca taken from her mother from the open ocean. During her capture, men shot and killed Shamu's mom right infront of her. She died 6 years later in 
captivity and SeaWorld still continues to name Orcas after her. With the help of Peta, the orca abuse was indentified and fought against. That helped lead to the abusive orca 
shows to be cancled and has helped the orcas get a better life in the parks. However, this doesn't mean that the abuse has ended. The abuse still very openly continues with them 
and the other creatures especially the dolphins. The dolphins go through sexual abuse and are often bread without them wanting too. In most cases the babies that are born are 
taken from their mothers and given to other locations around the country. Seaworld is a terrible place fro sea creatures so don't go there because all you're doing is supporting 
the animal cruelty.
